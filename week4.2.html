<p>Second day of this week started off cleaning up the lab to create a better and comfortable working environment ,When it comes to cleaning and organizing ,it became quiet fun.</p>

<h5 id="setting-the-height">Setting the height</h5>
<p>The first step is to roughly level the build plate by rotating the button at the front of your printer until there is approximately 1 mm distance between the nozzle and build plate. The measurement here is not critical, just make sure that the nozzle is close to the build plate without touching it</p>

<h4 id="bed-leveling">Bed leveling</h4>
<p>Maintaining a level print bed on 3D Printer is very important. High quality prints and reliable printing depend on a level bed, particularly at high resolutions. Mr.Francisco explained why it's so important, how to achieve it, and what we should do if we just can't get there with the printer.</p>
<p>Since the bed is leveled in relation to the plane of relative x-y motion of the nozzle , the nozzle should be consistent height above all points on the bed. This is a precise adjustment that benefits from great care and attention. to make sure uniform distance between the nozzle and bed we used a thick paper to seperate that tip from the bed.We passed this paper under the nozzle and if it is too encumbered we moved the platform away from the nozzle a little in that area. Wen it slides under the nozzle without resistance,we raised the platform towards the nozzle. The trick here is knowing the &quot;right&quot; amount of resistance.</p>
