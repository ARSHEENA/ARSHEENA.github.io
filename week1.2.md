###Ubuntu 14.04 installation
<div style ="width:800px;">

This is my first experiance with Ubuntu,i always used windows before,Luciano,out instructor insisted us to install Ubuntu 14.4. most of my collegues were experts in ubuntu,so i needed their help during each and every steps . The important thing before installation of Ubuntu is to create partitions in the available hard disk space by opening Manage, Computer Management, Storage. Luciano gave me a bootable pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 OS.

As my system doesn't have enough space and its already in slow condition,i couldn't go with virtual box,first i wanted to make sure that do i have got enough space on my computer to install Ubuntu.Luciano asked me to make free atleast 30GB,so i did back up some of my files to my HDD.then did the partition ,

Connected to the internet to get the latest updates while you install Ubuntu.

next step was booting from the pendrive. plugging in the boot able pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 restart the computer and choose to boot from the pendrive. 

 The installation process will began when you clicked the Install Now button.
 Click on the language option what i  need.Entered your login and password details,

Ubuntu needs about 4.5 GB to install, so i added a few extra GB to allow for my files.
