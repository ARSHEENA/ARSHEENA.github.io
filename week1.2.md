###Ubuntu 14.04 installation

This is my first experiance with Ubuntu,i always used windows before,Luciano,out instructor insisted us to install Ubuntu 14.4. most of my collegues were experts in ubuntu,so i needed their help during each and every steps . The important thing before installation of Ubuntu is to create partitions in the available hard disk space by opening Manage, Computer Management, Storage. Luciano gave me a bootable pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 OS.

As my system doesn't have enough space and its already in slow condition,i couldn't go with virtual box,first i wanted to make sure that do i have got enough space on my computer to install Ubuntu.Luciano asked me to make free atleast 30GB,so i did back up some of my files to my HDD.then did the partition ,
