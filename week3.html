<p>The project was design something productive using antimony then 3d print it,I designed a cup in antimony .it is first time i am using such an awsom 3d design software,antimony is a special type of Computer-Aided Design software. With this tool we can program your 3d model, instead of the standard click and drag interface. Well, for starters code is the closest thing to the ground truth of a software. And you want to stay close to it for some reasons: 1- it teaches you how to think and organize your ideas better as it is a strict logic process 2- letâ€™s you automate routine jobs and save precious time on the medium and long run 3- turns you into a powerful magician</p>
