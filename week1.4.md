Mr.Luciano asked us to develop a website to document our each and every activities of the Pre-FabAcademy,for that he asked to design a website using html5,firs i downloaded a bootstrap free template,as i am not familiar with html5 and i don't have much time i think now its better to use Markdown,Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
