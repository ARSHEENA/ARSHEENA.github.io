With this tool we can program your 3d model, instead of the standard click and drag interface.
Well, for starters code is the closest thing to the ground truth of a software. And you want to stay close to it for some reasons:


1- it teaches you how to think and organize your ideas better as it is a strict logic process


2- letâ€™s you automate routine jobs and save precious time on the medium and long run
3- turns you into a powerful magician

###Antimony installation in ubuntu
