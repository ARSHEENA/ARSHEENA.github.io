## About me

I have tried to extended my interest in use technology for dialy life as make yourself almost anything you want, in my opinion,it will play an important role in our life in the future than study theories ,win final exams and get a certificate and finaly get white collar job

Recently I discovered this awsome world of Fablab and Fab Academy, I was fascinated and I'm here to learn as much as I can in order to improve my skills and then find my way to make almost anything.
