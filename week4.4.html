<div align="justify" style="margin-left:2.5%" style="margin-right:3%">
<p>Mr.Franc gave a tutorial how to add components using Kokopelli,the task for was to design a board using Kokopelli by adding a LED,resistor and button to Neil’s existing helloworld.cad board. And then to mill the board using Modela and solder the components on to it. The board was designed as so: (not to scale)</p>

</center>
<p>Now downloaded the CAD file ,here is the link</p>
<p><a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html">hello.ftdi.44</a>.</p>
<p>Used gedit to open the cad file then find out the resistor,LED ,Button,copied it and edited the code in KoKopelli</p>

<p>To give the correct pin positions i reffered attiny44 data sheet</p>
<center>
<img src="img/hello/at.png" width="500"/>
</center>
<p>now the board designing part has got completed ,next step is to upload the file as png file, for that edited 20th and 21st line(delete#),then export as png.To mill the board we should upload the file as png. here is the traces that going to upload to mill</p>

</center>
<p>next step was milling,The files were then taken to the Modela and the design file was opened using FabModules.As i have already explained milling ,here i am not going to repeat it again, To learn more about using the Modella, check this</p>

<p>The trials and tribulations of generating code: the excitement, the anticipation...</p>
<p>Well, it might be a little amateurish, but I've done it. I made some changes today that messed it up, so I learnt a lot fixing it.</p>
<p>Here is my board after milling</p>

<p>soldering hello ftdi board:- Soldering part was quiet easy,as i have got experiance in soldering.One mistake i made during soldering was ,placed LED instead of resister,used the heat gun,desoldered it and made it ok.</p>

<p>Added a LED,RESISTOR AND BUTTON in using KOKOPELLI</p>
