## WEEK 1


### Introduction

The trainer for the Pre Fab academy Mr.Luciano Betlodi gave a brief introduction about Prefab training,Fab academy course ,subject matter, approach, breadth, and applicability of the course,corse duration,This was followed by a self introductions session.Rest of the day utalised for cleaning and setting up the lab for a good working environment in the coming days as recommended by Luciano.

## MERCURIAL INSTALLATION

In this part of the lecture, got an introduction about mercurial,to get setup on the course website using Mercurial. I'd heard of it before but not ever really looked into it in detail.
Mercurial is a cross-platform, distributed revision control tool for software developers.Tutorial which covers how to install Mercurial on Ubuntu and clone the Fab Academy archive helped me to install mercurial.
To communicate with the Fab Academy server in order to clone and communicate with the shared archive we should need SECURE SHELL ,for that i used this command

1. `sudo apt-get install ssh` 

2. Then to instal Mercurial - Type:
  `sudo apt-get install mercurial`

### Website Development for documetation




Mr.Luciano asked us to develop a website to document our each and every activities of the Pre-FabAcademy,for that he asked to design a website using html5,firs i downloaded a bootstrap free template,as i am not familiar with html5 and i don't have much time i think now its better to use Markdown,Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).






## CAD-Computer Aided Design

Luciano introduced CAD(Computer Aided design),and how we can use a Computer-aided design (CAD)in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design,importance of CAD during Fab Academy.

Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer programs to create two- or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) graphical representations of physical objects. CAD software may be specialized for specific applications. CAD is widely used for computer animation and special effects in movies, advertising, and other applications where the graphic design itself is the finished product. CAD is also used to design physical products in a wide range of industries, where the software performs calculations for determining an optimum shape and size for a variety of product and industrial design applications.The 2D and 3d designs created in this software can be used on a wide array of FabLab machines like from Vinyl cutter, Shopbot CNC router, Roland Modella milling machine, 3D printers etc. 

Luciano showed us different CAD softwares and he suggested to use Rhinoceros(for Windows),Rhino can create, edit, analyze, and translate NURBS curves, surfaces, and solids in Windows. There are no limits on complexity, degree, or size.

He gave a brief description about commands in Rhino and showed how to design a mould using Rhino.


####Design using Rhinoceros

This session  was completely for Rhinoceros,Luciano taught us before learning individual tools, we will be acquainted with the Rhino interface.He said these following exercises examine the interface elements used in Rhino: the Rhino window, viewports, menus, toolbars, and dialog boxes.  He gave a lecture about each and every commands ,we can  use to design and,  Rhinoceros is a really cool 2D and 3D design software. Its used for CAD in quick prototyping, designing stuff for 3D printing etc.I downloaded Rhino 5 for windows from the link below and a signed up a the free trail. .

Luciano , our trainer went forward with Rhinoceros training ,we got our first assignment using rhinos as well ...he shared a list of commands to do this assignment via slack.

Rhino Homework 1!
1. Polygon
2. Spiral
3. Cylinder
​4. Sweep1
​6. Bounding Box
​7. Boolean Difference
ho god....it took almost 4 hours to complete this design(my first work in rhinoceros.....!!!)

####Ubuntu installation continue...


Yesterday it was not installed in many of the computers. so today also the day started off installing linux , updating it etc.It took  almost 2 hours get the linux installed in all computers.
