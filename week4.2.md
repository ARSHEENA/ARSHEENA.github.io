### clean up the lab
Second day of this week started off cleaning up the lab to create a better and comfortable working environment ,When it comes to cleaning and organizing ,it became quiet fun.

### Leveling 3d printer tutorial by Frncisco

### Setting the height

The first step is to roughly level the build plate by rotating the button at the front of your printer until there is approximately 1 mm distance between the nozzle and build plate. The measurement here is not critical, just make sure that the nozzle is close to the build plate without touching it

#### Bed leveling

Maintaining a level print bed on 3D Printer is very important.  High quality prints and reliable printing depend on a level bed, particularly at high resolutions. Mr.Francisco explained why it's so important, how to achieve it, and what we should do  if we just can't get there with the printer.

Since the bed is leveled in relation to the plane of relative x-y motion of the nozzle , the nozzle should be consistent height above all points on the bed. This is a precise adjustment that benefits from great care and attention. to make sure uniform distance between the nozzle and bed we used a thick paper to seperate that tip from the bed.We passed this paper under the nozzle and if it is too encumbered we  moved the platform away from the nozzle a little in that area. Wen it slides under the nozzle without resistance,we raised the platform towards the nozzle.  The trick here is knowing the "right" amount of resistance.

Adjusting 3d printer filament pusher-a poorly adjusted or over tightened filament pushe can have adverse effects on our prints.
