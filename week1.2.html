<h3 id="ubuntu-14.04-installation">Ubuntu 14.04 installation</h3>
<p>This is my first experiance with Ubuntu,i always used windows before,Luciano,out instructor insisted us to install Ubuntu 14.4. most of my collegues were experts in ubuntu,so i needed their help during each and every steps . The important thing before installation of Ubuntu is to create partitions in the available hard disk space by opening Manage, Computer Management, Storage. Luciano gave me a bootable pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 OS.</p>
<p>As my system doesn't have enough space and its already in slow condition,i couldn't go with virtual box,first i wanted to make sure that do i have got enough space on my computer to install Ubuntu.Luciano asked me to make free atleast 30GB,so i did back up some of my files to my HDD.then did the partition ,</p>

<p>Connected to the internet to get the latest updates while you install Ubuntu</p>
<p>next step was booting from the pendrive. plugging in the boot able pendrive with Ubuntu 14.04 restart the computer and choose to boot from the pendrive.</p>
<p>The installation process will began when you clicked the Install Now button. Click on the language option what i need.Entered your login and password details,</p>
