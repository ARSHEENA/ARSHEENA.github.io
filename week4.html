<h1 id="week-4">WEEK 4</h1>
<p>This week our tutor was Fransisco from Fab lab trivandrum,this week was such an awsome learning week with fransisco. Design Hello ftdi using Kokopelli,leveling 3d printer,</p>

<p>Second day of this week started off cleaning up the lab to create a better and comfortable working environment ,When it comes to cleaning and organizing ,it became quiet fun.</p>
<h3 id="leveling-3d-printer-tutorial-by-frncisco">Leveling 3d printer tutorial by Frncisco</h3>
<p>Maintaining a level print bed on 3D Printer is very important. High quality prints and reliable printing depend on a level bed, particularly at high resolutions. Mr.Francisco explained why it's so important, how to achieve it, and what we should do if we just can't get there with the printer.</p>
<p>Since the bed is leveled in relation to the plane of relative x-y motion of the nozzle , the nozzle should be consistent height above all points on the bed. This is a precise adjustment that benefits from great care and attention. to make sure uniform distance between the nozzle and bed we used a thick paper to seperate that tip from the bed.We passed this paper under the nozzle and if it is too encumbered we moved the platform away from the nozzle a little in that area. Wen it slides under the nozzle without resistance,we raised the platform towards the nozzle. The trick here is knowing the &quot;right&quot; amount of resistance.</p>
<p>The frequency with which will need to perform a bed leveling is dependent largely on our printer's design, how careful when we removing parts, and how often you use the printer.</p>

<p>Adjusting 3d printer filament pusher-a poorly adjusted or over tightened filament pushe can have adverse effects on our prints .</p>

<p>Print a clip for 3D printer meterial ,Francisco gave me a design to print a clip for 3d printer meteial and asked to print it.</p>
<p>Cura software</p>
<p>Opened the image in Cura-&gt;selected Normal print-&gt;selected layers-&gt;then uploaded the image...next step was levelling 3d printer,then fed the design which i have to Ultimaker2,</p>
<p>After that i uploaded the image to Ultimaker2</p>

</div>
<p>3d printer started printing.....i wanted to make 10 clips...it took 2 hours to complete the print...</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/clip1.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>the process going on smoothly...here i got 10 numbers of the clip</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>this one is good...now i can use it to clip the filament coils.</p>

<p>The trials and tribulations of generating code: the excitement, the anticipation...</p>
<p>Well, it might be a little amateurish, but I've done it. I made some changes today that messed it up, so I learnt a lot fixing it.</p>
