<h1 id="week-4">WEEK 4</h1>
<h3 id="kokopelli-installation">KOKOPELLI INSTALLATION</h3>
<p>Kokopelli is a software tool for computer-aided design and manufacturing,an opensource tool the design the PCBs,2D and 3D models can described as Python scripts</p>
<p>I am new to Kokopelli and starting out right in the kokopelli for UBUNTU version 14.04.Our trainer for this week Mr.Franisco helped me since begining,first of all i downloaded KOKO-RETRO ZIP from the link -exctracted it open the folder koko-retro</p>
<h3 id="open-terminal-use-the-following-instruction">Open Terminal-Use the following instruction</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>make clean</code></li>
<li><code>cd bin</code></li>
<li><code>make fab</code></li>
<li><code>make install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>to open kokopelli</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./kokopelli -r</code></li>
</ul>
<p>the code was to draw a circle, but there were no circle as output,Error occured- No output</p>

</div>
<p>Terminal.........</p>

</div>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Francisco insisted to efer-&quot;github-mkeeter /kokopelli/wiki/installing&quot;,now i got the solution,that is,We should install some python libraries already in pc to run Kokopelli</p>
<p>and i got the required Python libraries are available through pip.</p>
<p><code>sudo pip install numpy PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate</code></p>
<p>Again i tried to open Kokopelli</p>
<p>open terminal</p>
<p>use the command 'sudo ./kokpelli -r</p>
<p>OopS.....Still no oputput....</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/error.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>To troubleshoot-referred http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu/-Downloads</p>
<p>I hope i can solve this problem by using following commands</p>
<p><code>make install</code> -this one will copy all executables and scripts to /usr/local/bin.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can add the bin folder to your path. To do this, add the line <code>*</code>export PATH=fab/bin:$PATH`</p>
<p>to ~/.bashrc, with fab/bin replaced by the location of the bin directory.</p>
<p>Finally it worked!!!!............i got the desired output...</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The very next step which i have donewas downloading the &quot;.cad&quot; file from the link</p>
<p><code>http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html</code></p>
<p>-opened the downloaded &quot;.cad&quot; file in Kokopelli, File-&gt;Open-&gt;hello.ftdi.44.cad</p>
<p>its format was quiet intresting,which display an ordered list in two columns, left side for the code, and right side the pcb preview.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Mr.Francisco gave a tutorial about the fuctions in kokopelli to add a component which we need,wire the component and allign the pcb,step by step tutorial to do add a component.</p>

<p>Second day of this week started off cleaning up the lab to create a better and comfortable working environment ,When it comes to cleaning and organizing ,it became quiet fun.</p>
<h3 id="leveling-3d-printer-tutorial-by-frncisco">Leveling 3d printer tutorial by Frncisco</h3>
<p>Maintaining a level print bed on 3D Printer is very important. High quality prints and reliable printing depend on a level bed, particularly at high resolutions. Mr.Francisco explained why it's so important, how to achieve it, and what we should do if we just can't get there with the printer.</p>
<p>Since the bed is leveled in relation to the plane of relative x-y motion of the nozzle , the nozzle should be consistent height above all points on the bed. This is a precise adjustment that benefits from great care and attention. to make sure uniform distance between the nozzle and bed we used a thick paper to seperate that tip from the bed.We passed this paper under the nozzle and if it is too encumbered we moved the platform away from the nozzle a little in that area. Wen it slides under the nozzle without resistance,we raised the platform towards the nozzle. The trick here is knowing the &quot;right&quot; amount of resistance.</p>
<p>The frequency with which will need to perform a bed leveling is dependent largely on our printer's design, how careful when we removing parts, and how often you use the printer.</p>

<p>Adjusting 3d printer filament pusher-a poorly adjusted or over tightened filament pushe can have adverse effects on our prints .</p>

<h3 id="d-printer-assignment">3D printer assignment</h3>
<p>Print a clip for 3D printer meterial ,Francisco gave me a design to print a clip for 3d printer meteial and asked to print it.</p>
<p>Cura software</p>
<p>Opened the image in Cura-&gt;selected Normal print-&gt;selected layers-&gt;then uploaded the image...next step was levelling 3d printer,then fed the design which i have to Ultimaker2,</p>
<p>After that i uploaded the image to Ultimaker2</p>

<img src="img/print.png" alt="" />
</center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/print2.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>3d printer started printing.....i wanted to make 10 clips...it took 2 hours to complete the print...</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/clip1.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>the process going on smoothly...here i got 10 numbers of the clip</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/print5.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>this one is good...now i can use it to clip the filament coils.</p>

<p>The trials and tribulations of generating code: the excitement, the anticipation...</p>
<p>Well, it might be a little amateurish, but I've done it. I made some changes today that messed it up, so I learnt a lot fixing it.</p>
