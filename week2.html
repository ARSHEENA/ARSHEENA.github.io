<h1 id="week-2">WEEK 2</h1>
<p>EXTREME MACHINES WEEK!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>This week was all about digital fabrication equipments we are using in fablab to build, code, solder, design pretty much anything they can think of(Vinyl cutter,PCB Milling Modella,Electronics workbench,Laser cutter,3D printer,shopbot,Molding and casting)</p>
<h3 id="vinyl-cutter-make-your-own-signs">Vinyl Cutter-Make your own signs!!!!</h3>
<h3 id="introduction-to-vinyl-cutter">Introduction to vinyl cutter</h3>
<p>Luciano gave an introduction about Roland CAMM-1 Servo vinyl cutter,Usage of Vinyl cutter,steps to make a sign,how to set up the mechine</p>

<h3 id="working-of-vinyl-cutter">working of vinyl cutter</h3>
<p>The vinyl cutter uses a small knife to precisely cut the outline of a picture into a sheet or piece of vinyl. The knife moves side to side and turns, while the vinyl is moved beneath the knife. What results from the cut process is an image cut into the material. The material is then 'weeded' where the excess parts of the picture are removed. It is possible to remove the positive parts, which would give a negative sticker, or you could weed the negative parts, giving a positive sticker. Removing the letters would be like removing the positive, giving a negative image of the word, etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-make-a-png-file">How to make a png file</h3>
<p>First of all i made a sticker of a basic design. The size was small,dx-150mm and dy.95mm .i thnink Keeping our first images small will help us master the process quickly with a minimum of materials.</p>
<p>Found out an image that i want to make into a sticker and made it black and white with no gray for best results.</p>
<p>Saved the image as a .png file.The software running the cutter likes to have a jpeg, Scaleable Vector Graphic (.SVG) can work fine as well.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<h3 id="setting-up">Setting up</h3>
<p>Load the sample piece of vinyl into the machine. On the left side in the front and back there are two LED 'eyes'. These are infared emitters and receivers which sense the presence of the vinyl.We have to position the vinyl so that it will cover these sensors. We also have to position the pressure rollers over the vinyl to make sure it will be able to handle the material. On the panel above the rollers, there are several white lines. The rollers must be positioned on these white lines or the machine wont run. i double checked the vinyl is running straight, or it may slip out from under the rollers. Flip the pressure lever to make the rollers press down, holding the vinyl between the rollers and the pressure bar.</p>
<p>next check the display. It shoulde say Sheer unloaded intil you engage the pressure roller. Then i used the down arrow to tell the machine thathave loaded a piece or a roll. As i chode choose piece, the cutter head moved sideways, measure the space between the rollers, then it will move the piece out, the back in, then to its original position. This process used the 'eyes' to measure the height of the piece.After that i was able to see the readout on the display of the pieces measurements.</p>
<h3 id="uploading-a-png-file">Uploading a png file</h3>
<p>Opened the terminal,as Fab modules are already installed ,we can use the command fab,then i got this window</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/scrr.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>the iselected the input format as image.png,output process as roland vinyl,the gave with work flow.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/scr.2.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>on next window loaded the image,resized it from 200mm to 150 mm,set the offset as 1,selected the option make path,now i can see the path through which the cutting will take place.then selected the option send it...now it starts the sign making process..</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/make.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>The cutter head started move side to side and the vinyl moved back and forth same time.</p>
<p>When the design is cut, used the arrow keys to move the vinyl out of the machine.</p>
<p>There is a groove on the front of the machine.There was enough material left,now used razor knife in this groove to cut the piece off. finally i got the image printed,,</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-pcb-milling-using-roland-modela-mdx-20">Introduction to PCB milling using Roland Modela MDX-20</h3>
<p>This machine is used to make PCBs for digital fabrication,this one is compatible with most 3d and 2d authoring software, making it ideal for the rapid prototyping of product designs.It becomes an essential part of Fab lab as it can use to milling of custom circuit boards, and the production of moulds. This Modela can be used on wood, mdf, modeling wax, plaster and FR1 circuit board blanks.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/modella.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>controls on the Roland Modela MDX-20</p>
<p>1 .The Green power button, well controls the power.</p>
<p>2 .View, moves the cutting head away and the base plate towards you so that you can place/see your cutting surface.</p>
<p>3 .Tool Up, moves the cutting head up.</p>
<p>4 .Tool Down, moves the cutting head down.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/control.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>During seting up the pcb milling board i used a double sided tape to fix the board in place,this is how it look like after setting up the milling board,Mr.Luciano insisted to preffer FR-1 copper boards(epoxy paper) as which is eco friendly than FR-4.In the beginning i started by taking the dimensions of milling bed to make sure that the boundaries don't collide with any of the parts of the machine.</p>
<p>The top layer of this is the sacrifice layer. It is only 3 mm deep and contains the holes for the screws to penetrate from the T clamps through it to the bolts in the bottom layer.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/board.png" alt="" />

</div>
<h4 id="bits-and-types">Bits and types</h4>
<p>There are 2 types * Flat * Ball here i preferred 2 flute Ball nose Bit to design my pcb</p>
<p>1 .1/32 Milling bits 2 .1/64 Milling bits</p>
<p>To mill out the traces of my circuit board i used 1/64th endmill(0.01 inch), and to cut the board from pcb used 1/32 endmill bit.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/bit.png" alt="" />

</div>
<h4 id="working">Working</h4>
<p>Putting the bit in</p>
<p>First of all i turned the Modela off and then on again to make it forget its previous z-zero setting. To double check itprobably used the view button to take it out of view mode. Then,slowely i did slide the bit into the modela. Now with the Allen key, gently tighten the hex-nut to tighten the bit.</p>
<p>Zeroing</p>
<p>To do this step moved the endmill over the board so that i can lower it to the copper. Used the rml_move tool, sending it the x and y you used as the origin when generating rml file above,made Xmin and Ymin.Next sept was setting up the Z axis manually,for that i lowered the bit as close as get to the copper plate but without touching it by keeping the down button pressed.when press the button once, the head moved the bit down exactly 7 mills i think...once the bit got resting just on the top of the milling surface,i loosened the set screws again using Allen key and pushed the bit all the way onto the copper,now i can hear a small tick, now i tightened the screws again.</p>
<p>now the mechine is all set to milling,next step is loading a png file and start milling.This step i hope i can do when i make FAB ISP PCB.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-fab-isp">Introduction to FAB ISP</h3>
<p>This session was about FAB Insystem Programmer, The FabISP is an in-system programmer for AVR microcontrollers, designed for production within a FabLab. That is, it allows us to program the microcontrollers on other boards we make, using nothing but a USB cable and 6-pin IDC to 6-pin IDC cable. It's based on the USBtiny and V-USB firmwares, which allow the ATtiny44 to perform USB communication in software. Programming can be done through avrdude. The schematic (PDF) is super simple: USB connector, ATtiny44, and 6-pin ISP header, with assorted passive components. I started with the Eagle files for the USBtinyISP, although there's almost nothing left of it. Most of the parts for the FabISP are in the FabLab inventory. Exceptions include the Mini-B USB connector (SparkFun, Digi-Key), 12 MHz crystal (Digi-Key), and 18 pF capacitors for the crystal (Digi-Key).</p>

<p>next step was loading the png using fab modules,The fab modules provide a set of software tools for personal fabrication, intended for use with machines common to fab labs.After installing the Fab modules, next select input and select file type as “.png” and the output as “Roland Modela MDX-20”. then loaded the png file,select make path,put the the offse value as 4,diameter as 0.4,now i am able to see the path thr0ugh which milling going to happen,put x and y as 20 to move the drilling bit and set the the position,next manually adjusted the z axis by pressing the down arrow,selected the bit 1/64 as i want to mill the traces first,</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/mill.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>Now its all ready to go,Click on the “Make .rml” button and send the machine file to the Modela by clicking on “Send It!”.. After which the machine will start milling and removing copper from around the traces.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/milli2.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>after milling the traces,next step was to cut the pcb from copper board ,for that i, had to change the bit first ,now i chose 1/32 bit loaded the cutout image then repeated the steps to set the bit and xyz plane,made the path,set diameter and offset,now pressed the make rml,now its ready to mill,the pressed start milling....This is my fabisp pcb after milling,even though it doesn't look perfect...its fine..</p>

<h3 id="soldering-fab-isp">Soldering FAB ISP</h3>
<p>This is my first soldering experiance, Soldering is the process of using a filler material (solder) to fix components in pcb sheet. Soldering occurs at relatively low temperatures (around 400 degrees Fahrenheit) as compared to brazing and welding, which actually melt and fuse the materials themselves at higher temperatures. In soldering the filler material becomes liquid, coats the pieces it is brought into contact with, and is then allowed to cool. As the solder cools it hardens, and the two materials are joined. Soldering is a quick way to join many types of materials, from copper pipe to stained glass. It creates an electrically conductive strong bond between components that can be re-heated (desoldered) if you should ever want to disconnect two items joined together. It's great for joining electrical components and wires and is used in just about everything electronic.</p>
<p>To solder the FAB ISP i downloaded the fab isp labelled board diagram from this link so that i can see what components you need to and where to place them on the board.</p>
<p><a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/hello.ISP.44.png!" class="uri">http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/hello.ISP.44.png!</a></p>
<p>i listed all the components required based on above labelled diagram</p>
<pre><code>1 ATTiny 44 microcontroller
1 Capacitor 1uF
2 Capacitor 10 pF
2 Resistor 100 ohm
1 Resistor 499 ohm

<h4 id="stuffs-i-used-for-soldering">stuffs i used for soldering</h4>
<p>1 .Solder</p>

</div>
<p>2 .soldering iron</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/irron.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>3 .Heat gun (to desolder any component)</p>
<p>As my instructor luciano insisted i started with small components like resistors,capacitors, If you haven't soldered before, it's probably good to practice with the smaller components (e.g. resistors and capacitors) before trying the microcontroller.</p>
<p>The USB connector was probably the hardest, because the traces are so narrow. I did the ISP header at the end, so it didn't get in the way when i was trying to solder other components. Most of the components was able to oriented either way, with the exception of the microcontroller (the circle marking pin 1 should be in the lower left) and the zener diodes,i forgot to take photographs during soldering,as we have got only 1 soldeing unit it was quiet busy during soldering process.... here is my fabisp after soldering....</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/fab2.png" alt="" />

</div>
<p>Troubleshooting Short Circuits:</p>
<p>To find soldering errors,i used digital microscope to do a visual inspection of the board and reflow any solder joints that look cold (not shiny and smooth).The mini USB header wasn't in a good form,so i had to resolder it.</p>
<pre><code>Then, used multimeter and check all the connections to make sure that:
- power and ground are not connected
- there is not a short on the power line.</code></pre>
<h3 id="programming-fab-isp">Programming FAB ISP</h3>
<p>This was quiet intresting,programming FAB ISP,To use FabISP as an ISP, it has to program first,To do this, i needed another (programmed) FabISP, some other in-system programmer (like an AVRISP mkII) or serial cable and dasa (level convertor) board.I used one of my collegues FABISP to program ATtiny44 in my FABISP.</p>
<p>As per the tutorial i closed SJ1 (the solder jumper near the microcontroller,after programming desoldered it to use my FABISP as a programmer) .Connected the 6 pin cable of the other programmer to my FabISP, made sure to orient it correctly (pin 1 to pin 1). to provide power to my FabISP used an USB cable connected to the computer .</p>
<p>To programm the FABISP first of all we had to install two softwares</p>
<ul>
<li>Avrdude (for programming AVR microcontrollers)</li>
<li>GCC (to compile C code)</li>
</ul>
<p>to install Get avrdude / GCC software and dependencies i used the following commands</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>sudo apt-get install flex byacc bison gcc libusb-dev avrdude</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>sudo apt-get install gcc-avr</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>sudo apt-get install libc6-dev</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>next step was download and unzip the firmware .for that i moved to the desktop then typed the below command</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cd ~/Desktop</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Downloaded the firmware from the Fab Academy Electronics Production page</p>
<p><a href="wget%20http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/firmware.zip">wget http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/firmware.zip</a></p>
<p>to Unzip the firmware</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unzip firmware.zip</code></li>
</ul>
<p>to do programming the board needs power ,to make sure that the mini USB connector for the FabISP trying to program is plugged into my computer AND that a separate pogramer is plugged in to the 6-pin programming header. (i used another working FabISP )</p>
<p>next step was editing the make file,for that i used the command</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gedit Makefile</code></li>
</ul>
